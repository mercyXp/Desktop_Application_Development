## Desktop Application Development

Building **applications that run directly on a computer** (Windows, macOS, Linux), not in a browser or on a phone.

With Python GUI, you use libraries such as:

* **Tkinter** (built-in, beginner-friendly)
* **PyQt** / **PySide** (professional-grade, supports modern UI)
* **Kivy** (cross-platform, can also build mobile apps)
* **CustomTkinter** (modern version of Tkinter with better themes)
